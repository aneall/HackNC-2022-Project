# EduVeRse - HackNC 2022 Project
## Creator: Ashley Neall

Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), "a web framework for building virtual reality experiences" and Wix, utilizing glitch as my web-based IDE of choice.

Thanks to the environments I built by importing pre-made assets into html code, with the help of A-Frame, the experiences accessible on the EduVeRse website are compatible with desktops, smartphones, and headsets.
